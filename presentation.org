* What are Cryptic Crosswords?
#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='vertspace1'></div>
A style of crossword most popular in the UK, little-known in the US.

Every quality UK newspaper (e.g. /The Times/, /The Guardian/, /The Independent/)\\
publishes one every day.

They are followed by a non-vocal fandom...

* US vs UK
#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='vertspace1'></div>
The grids are quite different.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 40% :align left
#+REVEAL_HTML: <img src="nytimes.png" style="width:500px; height:500px">

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 40% :align right
#+REVEAL_HTML: <img src="guardian.png" style="width:500px; height:500px">

* The Clues
#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='vertspace1'></div>
"Normal" (so-called "quick") crossword clues are often\\
straightforward synonymous definitions.

~US State, Capital Boise (5)~

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='vertspace1'></div>
Cryptic clues are... more twisted.

But there are rules! And conventions!

* Clue breakdown
#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='vertspace1'></div>
Every* clue points to the answer in two ways:

Somewhere in the clue (usually at one end or the other) is the /definition/.

The rest of the clue is the /wordplay/. When decoded, it will give the same answer.

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='vertspace1'></div>
Clues are designed to throw you off the scent: you must /ignore/ the /surface/
meaning, punctuation, etc, and consider carefully each word.\\
In a good clue, no word is superfluous.

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='vertspace1'></div>
Clues may not mean what they (appear to) say, but they must say what they mean!

* Clue type: Anagram
#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='vertspace1'></div>
One of the easiest types of clue is the anagram.

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='vertspace1'></div>
~Spin doctor live, on tour (10)~

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='vertspace1'></div>
Many many words can be anagram indicators: anything that suggests letters being
potentially changed, upset, moved, made anew, etc.

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='vertspace1'></div>
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
~REVOLUTION~\\
("doctor" LIVE ON TOUR)

* Clue type: Hidden
#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='vertspace1'></div>
Another "easy" one.

Sometimes (usually not more than once per puzzle) the answer
is hidden directly inside the clue, either forwards or backwards. This is
indicated by a suitable word like "some".

You would /think/ this would make it easy.

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='vertspace1'></div>
~Maybe wearing some larger undies (6)~

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='vertspace1'></div>
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
~GERUND~\\
("wearing" is one example -- "maybe" -- of a gerund)

* Clue type: Cryptic Definition
#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='vertspace1'></div>
Sometimes* the answer is clued in a playful way.

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='vertspace1'></div>
~Fallout when the deal is subjected to cuts? (7)~

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='vertspace1'></div>
*Almost always. Straight definitions are rare and\\
would be considered poor in a cryptic clue.

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='vertspace1'></div>
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
~SAWDUST~\\
(*deal*​² /noun/ a plank or planks of soft wood)

* Clue type: Double Definition
#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='vertspace1'></div>
A two word clue is very often a double definition.

Both words, interpreted in the right way, mean the same thing - the answer.

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='vertspace1'></div>
~Potty train (4)~

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='vertspace1'></div>
DDs can be more than two words, of course.

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='vertspace1'></div>
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
~LOCO~\\
(*potty*​¹ /adj/ /colloq/ mad; crazy)

* Clue type: Charade
#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='vertspace1'></div>
A very common type of clue has the answer made up from parts put together. The
parts might be obtained using other tricks in the setter's arsenal.

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='vertspace1'></div>
~Former lover can court no more (7)~

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='vertspace1'></div>
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
~EXTINCT~\\
("former lover" = EX, "can" = TIN, "court" = CT)

* Other Common Devices
#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='vertspace1'></div>
 - Using letters from the start/end/middle of words
 - Letter deletions from words
 - Taking alternate letters from a word
 - Reversing words
 - Substitutions
 - Spoonerisms
 - Homophones (it helps to have a British accent)

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='vertspace1'></div>
~Cut disease with unlimited money (1-4)~

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='vertspace1'></div>
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
~T-BONE~

* Abbreviations
#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='vertspace1'></div>
You would be surprised how many meanings are given (/in the dictionary/)\\
to each single letter.

But: you /cannot just/ abbreviate any word to its initial letter;\\
it /must/ be in the dictionary (often Chambers).

e.g. The letter R is fairly clued by any of:\\
right, river, King (/Rex/), Queen (/Regina/), resistance, run.\\
Or even: take (/recipe/)!

But not e.g. rabbit.

* Clue type: &lit
#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='vertspace1'></div>
The "holy grail" clue where the whole clue is both the definition and the
wordplay. Quite rare.

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='vertspace1'></div>
~A position with game in front of it (6)~

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='vertspace1'></div>
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
~GOALIE~\\
("A position" = A LIE, "game" = GO)

* A thing of beauty
#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='vertspace1'></div>
Sometimes a clue can be so good, it makes your whole week.

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='vertspace1'></div>
~Such sickness and suffering originate with medic, ultimately (10)~

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='vertspace1'></div>
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
~IATROGENIC~\\
(Anagram [suffering] of ORIGINATE with last letter [ultimately] of mediC)

* Styles and setters
#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='vertspace1'></div>
Each crossword is the work of one person (the /setter/).\\
Different setters have different styles.

 - When I see Fed, it's going to involve lots of letter-play, some deviousness
 - When I see Paul, there's going to be cross-referential clues, risque surfaces
 - When I see Pasquale, there will be some recondite words
 - When I see Brummie or Picaroon, I'm good - it's going to be chewy but doable
 - When I see Imogen, I cry... I am not on their wavelength at all

A setter's job is to put up a good fight, and lose bravely.

RIP Nutmeg, one of the best for smooth surfaces and fair clueing.

* Cryptics affect your mind
#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='vertspace1'></div>
#+REVEAL_HTML: <table style="margin:0 auto">
#+REVEAL_HTML: <tbody><tr><th>You see...</th><th>You think...</th></tr>
#+REVEAL_HTML: <tr><td>"banker" or "flower"</td><td>river</td></tr>
#+REVEAL_HTML: <tr><td>"issue"</td><td>children</td></tr>
#+REVEAL_HTML: <tr><td>"sweetheart"</td><td>E</td></tr>
#+REVEAL_HTML: <tr><td>"unknown"</td><td>X, Y, Z</td></tr>
#+REVEAL_HTML: <tr><td>"corporation"</td><td>tum</td></tr>
#+REVEAL_HTML: <tr><td>"Nice day"</td><td>jour</td></tr>
#+REVEAL_HTML: <tr><td>"leg"</td><td>on</td></tr>
#+REVEAL_HTML: <tr><td>"posh"</td><td>U</td></tr>
#+REVEAL_HTML: </tbody></table>

* How on earth...?
#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='vertspace1'></div>
You get reasonably good at them after some years (decades?) of daily practice.

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='vertspace1'></div>
Among many other things, you should have some knowledge of: Greek/Roman/Norse
myths; classic (and classical) literature; Shakespeare; current events;
pre-decimal British currency; military abbreviations; sporting and gaming terms,
especially cricket, golf, chess, and bridge; musical terms; high school French;
Latin phrases; the NATO alphabet; Roman numerals; Greek letters; the Periodic
Table; countries; cities; rivers; currencies; Cockney rhyming slang; and short
synonyms and examples of anything and everything.

* Now for the question
#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='vertspace1'></div>
Can ChatGPT solve cryptic crossword clues?

Of course, the answer is: no.

Ironically, cryptics /are/ quite doable by specialized programs...

* A short conversation
"I'm going to give you cryptic crossword clues and I'd like you to solve them
and explain the solution.

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='vertspace1'></div>

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
"Sure! I'd be happy to help you solve cryptic crossword clues.

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
To solve a cryptic crossword clue, [{{{hilite(blah blah blah explanation we don't need)}}}].

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
To start, could you give me one of the clues that you would like me to solve?

* A short conversation
"Owl pursuing pussycat that's possibly ours, grabbing it (6)"

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
"In this clue, the word "owl" is a hint\\
that the answer is a type of bird. [{{{hilite(wrong)}}}]

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
The word "pursuing" suggests that the answer is something that is following or
chasing something else, which could be the word "pussycat." [{{{hilite(uhhh...)}}}]

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
The word "that's possibly ours" could be a hint that the answer is a word that
sounds like "ours." [{{{hilite(wrong)}}}]

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
Taking all of these clues into consideration, it seems likely that the answer to
this clue is the word "spoon." [{{{hilite(wrong)}}}]

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
"Spoon" is a type of bird that is known for its ability to follow and chase
insects, and it also sounds like the word "pursue." [{{{hilite(???)}}}]

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
"Grabbing" the word "pussycat" could be a hint that the answer is a type of
spoon, such as a dessert spoon or a tablespoon. The answer to this clue is
therefore "SPOON."

* A short conversation
"That's not right. The answer is SUITOR. Can you explain why?

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
"I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. You are correct that the
answer to this clue is SUITOR.

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
[blah blah blah]

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
When we put these two clues together, we get the word "SUITOR," which fits the
definition of the answer and also sounds like "pussycat" and "ours."

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
Therefore, the answer to this clue is SUITOR.

* LLMs will never do cryptics
#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='vertspace1'></div>
There are some things LLMs will (/should/) never do.

Cryptic crosswords are in that category.

#+REVEAL_HTML: <div class='vertspace1'></div>
~Prince left island country to pursue posh college dream (13)~

 - The /point/ of a cryptic clue is to /subvert the normal/ interpretation (the opposite of
what LLMs are designed to deal with)

 - Solving a cryptic is like reading a book: it's a connection with the author.
What would be the point of using a computer?
